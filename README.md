# ESL-P2-Survival-Analysis

## Background

Survival analysis (aka. time-to-event analysis) is significant in answering many engineering questions such as, how long will customers remain with your business, how long will this machine work before malfunction and how long from from surgery to death. Analyses like these are based on time-to-event data that consist of a distinct start time and end time.

## Problem statement

The focus of this project is to design, implement, test, compare, and document survival analysis algorithms for predicting time-to-event, e.g. time to onset of disease or time to machine malfunction. The algorithms must be optimized with regard to prediction accuracy and explain-ability/interpret-ability, i.e. results must be shown such that end-users readily can see the basis for the predictions. To quantify the quality of the algorithms, comparative evaluations should be carried out via objective metrics and the algorithms should be assessed against state of the art.
